# Rust Top-Down 

This is an overview/tutorial of the Rust programming language for progrmamers coming from 'higher' level languages.

[The Rust Programming Language - aka 'The Book'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is a *great* resource and should certainly be used in conjuction with the content if you are new to Rust programming.  

Rust code and libraries are also easily 'self-documented', and one of the best examples is the `std` crate.  (a `crate` being the equivilant of an npm or nuget package).  [std](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)  For core concepts (e.g. references, types, etc.), the api documentation often provides conceptual context that is very helpful.
